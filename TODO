- PEP8 checks on code
- Since this can clone hg repos as well, perhaps this shouldn't be a git
  extension; may be it should be get-the-code?

  Counter-argument: The vast majority of repos will be git, and people are
  used to typing to git to grab code, so this fits seemlessly into that
  process.

- --recursive - could use requirements.txt or Gemfile to recursive clone
  dependent projects so that you have all related source code at once.

  git clone-canonical --recursive=nova-project nova
  cloning nova into 'nova-project'
  cloning sqlalchemy into 'nova-project'
  cloning sqlalchemy-migrate into 'nova-project'
