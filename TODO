- auto-update locations.txt if older then a day (later a week)
- PEP8 checks on code
- script to ensure no dup names in locations.txt
- Since this can clone hg repos as well, perhaps this shouldn't be a git
  extension; may be it should be get-the-code?

  Counter-argument: The vast majority of repos will be git, and people are
  used to typing to git to grab code, so this fits seemlessly into that
  process.
